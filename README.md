ffmpeg-ios-compile
==================

Those scripts help you compile ffmpeg libs for iOS Device/Simulator.
You need 'XCode Developer_3.2.5' to compile ffmpeg libs for iOS.

I compiled my own ffmpeg libs for iOS with the same scripts here without any errors.

Execute those shell scripts in root directory of ffmpeg v1.0.

1) config_i386.sh
Compile libs for iOS Simulator.

2) config_v6.sh config_v7.sh
Compile libs for armv6(iPhone 3G) / v7(iPhone 3Gs or later).

3) config_v7s.sh
Gcc 4.2 in Xcode does not support v7s.
This script is not working, have to upgrade.

4) config_x64.sh
Test ffmpeg on Mac.

5) combile_lipo.sh
Compbile specified arches into on universal lib file.

6) gas-preprocessor/
Before your run those scripts, copy gas-preprocessor.pl to your usr/bin.

7) armv7s/
Fake armv7s support


Usage example:

xw# cd ffmpeg-1.0

xw# make distclean
xw# ../config/config_v6.sh 
xw# make -j9 && make install

xw# make distclean
xw# ../config/config_v7.sh 
xw# make -j9 && make install

xw# make distclean
xw# ../config/config_vi386.sh 
xw# make -j9 && make install

xw# ../config/combile_lipo.sh

xw# open dist-universal



About Dolby
------------------

DO NOT use dolby tech in your iOS app unless you have a dolby license.

Those scripts have removed the following tech from your ffmpeg v1.0 configuration:

Dolby Digital (AC3)
Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC3)
Dolby TrueHD (MLP)
